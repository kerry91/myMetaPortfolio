This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**Portfolio page functionality**
<br/>
When interacting with the portfolio app:

- Did the header have external links that take you to different social apps? 
- Did the header have internal links that, when clicked, will smoothly scroll into their corresponding section? 
- Was the landing section filled with an avatar, name and a short bio? 
- Did the project section display a 2x2 grid with each project rendered in a card widget? 
- Was the Contact Me form business logic implemented as per the requirements? 
- Can you suggest any improvements for the portfolio app?
